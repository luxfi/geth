# Avalanche to Lux Migration Report

## Summary

After searching through the entire coreth codebase, I found that most references to Avalanche/Ava-labs have already been updated to Lux. Here's what I found:

## Already Updated âœ…

1. **Import Paths**: All Go import paths have been updated from `github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego` to `github.com/luxfi/node`
2. **Module Name**: The go.mod file correctly uses `module github.com/luxfi/coreth`
3. **Copyright Headers**: Files show "Lux Partners Limited" in copyright notices
4. **README.md**: Already references Lux network and documentation
5. **Dockerfile**: Uses `github.com/luxfi/node` and builds Lux Node
6. **Configuration**: Chain configs use "Lux" naming (LuxMainnetChainConfig, LuxFujiChainConfig, etc.)
7. **Context Variables**: Uses LuxContext in configuration

## No Changes Needed

1. **Chain IDs**: The chain IDs (43114 for mainnet, 43113 for Fuji, 43112 for local) remain the same as these are established network identifiers
2. **Network Names**: "Fuji" testnet name is retained as it's an established testnet identifier
3. **External Data Hashes**: The JSON files (fuji_ext_data_hashes.json, mainnet_ext_data_hashes.json, etc.) contain blockchain data hashes that should not be modified

## Observations

1. **No Hardcoded URLs**: No hardcoded references to avalanche.network or ava-labs.com were found
2. **No User-Facing Strings**: No user-facing strings mentioning "Avalanche" were found in the codebase
3. **Documentation**: All documentation URLs in README.md already point to lux.network
4. **Security Policy**: SECURITY.md already references Lux and the appropriate bug bounty program

## Conclusion

The coreth repository appears to be fully migrated to Lux branding. No additional changes are required for:
- User-facing strings
- Constants and variable names  
- Import paths
- Hardcoded URLs or references

The codebase is ready for use with the Lux network.
